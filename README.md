Impact Of Pulitzer Prize

====================

Our team fetched stories from the current winners and finalists of the Pulitzer Prizes website (www.pulitzer.org). Since there were only 18 years of data available on the website, our team read and stored stories from 12 different fields of the finalists between 1995 and 2012 using Python. To fetch this content, our team imported urllib2 and BeautifulSoup packages to our impactOfJournalism.py project. This Python project fetches web content of the Pulitzer winners and finalists from the year of 1995 to the year of 2011. This project stores words of each article not appeared in the stoplist to pulitzer-category.csv file.
